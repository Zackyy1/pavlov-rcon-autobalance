# pavlov-rcon-autobalance
A script that auto-balanced teams when one team has 2 or more people than on the other team.
The lowest scoring player (or the one who has just switched) will be balanced out to prevent top-scoring players from being moved forcefully.

Make sure you install async-pavlov
`pip install async-pavlov`
